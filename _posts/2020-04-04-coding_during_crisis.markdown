I sat down to start my CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project on March 14. On Sunday Morning, March 15, my father-in-law called to say my mother-in-law might die. My MIL had been sick for over a week and had gone to the ER on Saturday. She had a high fever and shortness of breath but had seemed stable. Her O2 levels dropped over the next 24 hours and she was placed on a ventilator and moved to the ICU. At the time of this post, she is still in the ICU on a ventilator.

Now back to Sunday. When we got the call, we threw some clothes into a bag and rushed out the door. The state of Washington was shut down but we headed south not quite sure where we would end up. We couldn’t go to my in-laws house because of the likelihood of  ourselves becoming infected so we headed to Seattle where my brother-in-law lives. I left my laptop at home knowing that I wouldn’t have the time or motivation to work on my project.

When we made it to Seattle, the dust settled a bit. My MIL was in critical condition and positive for COVID-19 but steps were being taken to improve her condition. What followed was a rollercoaster ride that has continued ever since. Part of this ride was starting and finishing my CLI project.

It would be impossible to reflect on this project without focusing on the bigger scope of the crisis that had hit the family. I would find time throughout the day to work, knowing that any moment could bring good or bad news. Each time the phone rang I would get up from my desk and try to listen in at what the Doctors or Nurses were relaying. I found it impossible to focus on my project for more than a few minutes at a time. Each minute seemed so precious.

This time of crisis has taught me the importance of setting small and achievable goals. Before getting to work I would write down one method I wanted to write or one bug I wanted to fix. Working on one item at a time allowed me to focus on what was in front of me and not worry about the ‘big picture.’ 

The project itself is quite simple. One class scrapes the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Mountain Passes website and converts the data into a hash. Another class turns the data in the hash into object properties. A third class runs the program for the user. Completing the project was not so simple. 

I knew that this project was going to test my knowledge of what I have learned from the curriculum. Each line of code can be traced back to a particular lesson from the Learn Curriculum. The video lectures were essential in providing the foundation for this project. These videos helped me get to a place where I could then use the Learn Curriculum or other resources on the web to build up my project. 

As the days ticked by the program grew bigger but so did my stress. Each day brought news from the hospital. Each day was a roller coaster. I would get excited when I finally got a piece of my program functioning, only to feel a pit in my stomach knowing that my MIL was still very sick. Writing this blog feels like a victory, while at the same time I still have that pit in my stomach.

I’m excited to finally turn in my project. The culmination of hard work and dedication. I struggle separating the stress of turning in my first project with the stress of being in a crisis. It can be difficult to look towards beginning a new chapter with the Learn Curriculum when it's impossible to know what tomorrow might look like for my family. Coding during a crisis is a rollercoaster, but you need to stay on until the ride has ended.

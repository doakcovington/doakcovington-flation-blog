The year is 2014. A fresh Community Health grad is ready to take on the world of healthcare. After two and a half years of grinding through excel sheets and healthcare data, this Community Health worker is officially burnt out. This Community Health worker is me.  

Health data is huge. Now more than ever, it's important to equip people with the tools and knowledge to track their own health. If someone knows how to effectively track their vital signs, they will be more aware of what's going on with their bodies. The hope is that this will encourage people to seek medical advice when necessary and not wait until it's ‘too late.’

After finishing my Rails module, I decided to take a break and build my first side project. I built a pulse oximeter tracking app using React. I enjoyed using my new software engineering skills with my health experience. I knew early on that I want my JS/Rails portfolio project to also be health focused.

A few months ago my mother-in-law was discharged from the hospital after a long stay due to COVID-19. She came home with a ton of papers including a daily vital record sheet that she needed to fill out. I felt that replicating this piece of paper as a single page web app would make a great project. 

I spent two days on prep-work. Writing my user story, drawing my models, and wireframing the app. This prep-work paid off, as I was able to focus on building what I planned, instead of building what was currently in my mind. I also tried to take a more vertical approach with building this project.

I’m excited to continue onto React, while still focusing on JavaScript fundamentals.

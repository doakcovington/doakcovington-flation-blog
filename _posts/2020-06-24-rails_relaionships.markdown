Building a strong and healthy relationship takes time and energy. The hope is that the more you put into a relationship, the more you should get out of it. There should be some give and take. ActiveRecord relationships might make your life a whole lot easier, but learning and building them still takes time and energy.

Before writing any code for this project, I drew out my models on a piece of paper. I did this 10 or so times before I was satisfied with the models and how they related to each other. At the start, I was thinking too ‘literal’ with my models. I wasn’t thinking about how ActiveRecord defines these associations and what comes with these associations.

What finally helped was opening up the Rails Documentation and using the Active Record Associations to help guide my models I was drawing on paper. The Rails Documentation has been a great resource. 

Looking back at previous projects, there seems to be a ‘lesson learned’ that I took from the project that I wish I would’ve started using earlier. For the CLI project it was pry and using it as a powerful debugging tool. For Sinatra, it was planning out my project beforehand. For Rails, it will be reading and understanding the documentation.

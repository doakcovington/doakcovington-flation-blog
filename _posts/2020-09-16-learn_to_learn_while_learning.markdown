This has been my most used ‘test’ description for my React/Redux project. I’m building out an event creator and management app. My wife works at a local high school and helps facilitate the after school tutoring center. The local school district has started the school year fully online. Instead of making eye catching flyers, tutoring center staff are relying on dated wordpress websites and emails to notify students of upcoming events. I knew this was a great opportunity to create a proof of concept site for the school and learn React/Redux at the same time. 

I’ve spent the better part of the past two years learning how to program. It's amazing how far this program has brought me. A few months ago I was struggling to build out a CLI project. I was wondering if I really had ‘it.’ I now have multiple projects under my belt and a portfolio of work to be proud of. 

Each project has been a stepping stone to the next. My CLI and Sintra apps seem so simple, but they set a strong foundation in the fundamentals needed to build out bigger projects. The beauty of React/Redux is that while my app is far from ‘simple’ it still feels simple and easy to use. 

Graduation is right around the corner, but I will keep doing what I’ve been doing for the past 2 years...learn.
